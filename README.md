# Responsive Navbar with HTML, CSS and Javascript

In this lesson, I will show you how to create a responsive em. In other to do this, I made the UI version in Adobe XD which will serve as the project guide throughout the short lesson. 

To get along quickly with this course, you will need basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge.

First, we will use HTML to build our project structure; at some point, we will add the CSS styling by making sure it appears nicely on almost every screen sizes. And finally, we will add the JavaScript functions that will respond to user clicks on small and big screen. 

So, let us dive into it!

## HTML
*We created the project structure using the HTML5.*   


## CSS 

These are some of the declaration in CSS you will get used to after the lesson:

## Javascript Logic
With Javascript, web developers can manipulate the DOM; in this tutorial, toggle an `open_nav` class whenever the user clicks on the hamburger menu or any of the dropdown menu buttons.

### Key Concept: 

*[Event bubbling](https://javascript.info/bubbling-and-capturing) and event capturing was used to capture clicks whenever the user clicks on the button. Which also allows us to manipulate the [parent element](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_node_parentelement.asp).*

* [JavaScript String toUpperCase() Method](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_touppercase.asp)
* [HTML DOM children Property](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_element_children.asp)
* [JavaScript HTML DOM EventListener](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_eventlistener.asp)
